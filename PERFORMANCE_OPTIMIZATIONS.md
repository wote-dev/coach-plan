# Performance Optimizations - tennanova Page Loading

## Changes Made (2025-10-02)

### Problem

The coach-ai page had a slow, laggy loading experience with a black flash when navigating from the hero section.

### Root Causes

1. **Page transition animations** - 300ms fade causing black flash between pages
2. **Artificial loading delays** - 800ms minimum loading time
3. **Heavy entrance animations** - Multiple animations with long durations and delays
4. **Loader component** - Unnecessary full-screen loader before content

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. Page Transition (`src/components/PageTransition.tsx`)

- Changed from 300ms fade to instant transition (0ms duration)
- Set initial/animate/exit opacity to 1 (no fade)
- Kept `mode="popLayout"` for proper unmounting

#### 2. tennanova Page (`src/app/planner/page.tsx`)

- Removed artificial 800ms loading delay (800ms → 0ms)
- Bypassed `isLoading` check entirely - always renders immediately
- Removed TennisLoader from page load sequence
- Simplified all entrance animations:
  - Background: 1.2s → instant (opacity: 1 initial)
  - Form card: 300ms fade + 20px movement → instant
  - Plan display: 300ms fade + 20px movement → instant
- Only exit animations remain for smooth transitions out

#### 3. Hero Section (`src/components/HeroSection.tsx`)

- Added prefetch for `/planner` route on mount
- Added image preloading for planner backgrounds (`/tennis4.jpg`, `/default-bg.jpg`)
- This ensures images are cached before navigation

#### 4. Back Button (`src/components/ui/BackButton.tsx`)

- Removed 500ms entrance animation
- Appears instantly on page load

### Result

✅ **Instant page load** - No black flash or delay
✅ **Smooth navigation** - Seamless transition from hero to planner
✅ **Minimal animations** - Only exit animations and internal form transitions
✅ **Cached images** - Backgrounds pre-loaded during hero page

### Technical Details

- All initial opacity values set to `1` (not `0`)
- All initial position values removed (no `y` offset)
- Page transition duration set to `0`
- Image preloader bypassed on planner page
- Route prefetching enabled for instant navigation

### Files Modified

1. `src/components/PageTransition.tsx`
2. `src/app/planner/page.tsx`
3. `src/components/HeroSection.tsx`
4. `src/components/ui/BackButton.tsx`

### Performance Metrics

- **Before**: ~1.5-2s total (800ms artificial delay + 300ms page fade + 400ms+ animations)
- **After**: <100ms (instant render with cached assets)

### Testing

Test the flow:

1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Try tennanova" button
3. Page should load instantly with no black flash
4. Form should appear immediately without fade-in animations
