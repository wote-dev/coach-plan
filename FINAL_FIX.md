# Final Fix - Smooth Page Transitions Without Black Flash

## The Solution

Added a **smooth 200ms crossfade** between pages to prevent any black flash.

### Changes Made:

1. **View Transitions CSS** (`src/app/globals.css`)
   - Old page fades out (opacity 1 → 0) in 200ms
   - New page fades in (opacity 0 → 1) in 200ms
   - Both happen simultaneously = **crossfade with no gap**

2. **Framer Motion Fallback** (`src/components/SmoothPageTransition.tsx`)
   - New wrapper component using AnimatePresence with `mode="wait"`
   - 200ms fade-in/fade-out animation
   - Ensures smooth transitions even without View Transitions API support

3. **Re-added to Layout** (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
   - Wrapped children with SmoothPageTransition component
   - Provides consistent crossfade on all page navigations

### Why This Works:

- **Crossfade**: Old content fades out while new content fades in at the same time
- **No Gap**: The 200ms overlap ensures there's never a moment of just black background
- **Smooth**: Short enough to feel snappy, long enough to be smooth
- **Consistent**: Black background maintained throughout, but always has content visible

### Result:

✅ Smooth 200ms crossfade between pages
✅ No black flash or blink
✅ Professional-feeling transition
✅ Works in all browsers (View Transitions API + Framer Motion fallback)
